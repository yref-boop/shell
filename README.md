# linux-shell
shell done as homework for the operating systems subject

### libraries & tecnologies:
`gcc`

the different project branches represent different submissions:
  - shell-0 base shell (info, inner workings, historic list ... )
  - shell-1 filesystem (create, erase ... )
  - shell-2 memory (malloc, dealloc, map ...)
  - main process (fork, uids ... )

each version is built upon the previous one

the base shell however, was rewritten on memory shell, since several problems were found
